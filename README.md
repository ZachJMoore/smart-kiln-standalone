The thermocouple are screwed directly to the amp. Neutral/ground coming back from the kiln elements can then also be screwed into the relay to programmatically close the circuit

### Software Setup

After enabling SPI to be used on the raspberry pi, in the root directory, run in terminal the following to start the server:

```
    $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
    $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
    $ npm install
    $ node app/app.js
```
